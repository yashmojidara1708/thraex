                    <b>Level I: </b> This involves an analysis of your project requirements to determine the optimal process
                    flow, melting method,
                    moulding system, sand system requirements, and other essential aspects of the foundryâ€”from the core room
                    to the
                    final finishing and shipment of castings. We provide a Concept General Arrangement drawing, a top-level
                    budget,
                    and supporting documents. This level of engineering equips you with information crucial for justifying
                    the project,
                    presented in a format suitable for a board presentation.

                    <b>Level II:</b> Once approval is obtained following Level I engineering, the concepts developed during
                    the initial study
                    become the foundation for creating a detailed layout. A Level II package includes a comprehensive plan
                    view, key
                    elevation drawings, a detailed implementation schedule, and fixed equipment pricing. It also
                    incorporates a realistic
                    budget for the installation phase. With the final submission of this package, the project implementation
                    can commence.
